# BraDyCMS docs

Welcome to BraDyCMS.
This is the documentary section of **BraDyCMS**, that we are ceaselessly improving.
Some sections need to be updated, other need to be written, other need heavy revisions.

For this reason any **help** in improving and maintaining this documentation will be **much appreciated**.
The documentation is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, which is 
an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format; then, it can be converted to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
Check the basic tools of the Markdown syntax here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics and
the full syntax documentation here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.

3. Submit a pull request
